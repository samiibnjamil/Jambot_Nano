# üìù Project Log

## 2024-04-17
- Created prompts.md for storing ROS 2 specific AI prompts
- Updated RViz configuration path in view_robot.launch.py
- Pushed all project files to GitHub repository
- Implemented hardware interface for Arduino Nano communication
- Added URDF files for robot description
- Created launch files for robot visualization and control

## AI Interactions
- Assisted with RViz configuration and path fixing
- Helped with Git repository management
- Provided guidance on ROS 2 project structure
- Assisted with hardware interface implementation

## Project Structure
- Organized package following ROS 2 conventions
- Created necessary directories (src, include, launch, config, etc.)
- Set up proper documentation files (README.md, PLANNING.md, TASK.md, RULES.md)

## Next Steps
- Implement remaining tasks from TASK.md
- Add unit tests for hardware interface
- Complete URDF updates for new components
- Set up Gazebo simulation environment

## 2025-04-15
